## Usage

Coming with a base understanding of the [NextJS opinions and documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), will give you a solid grasp on the structure of our templates.

## File structure

## Breakdown

‚Äî **_jsconfig.js_**

NextJS lets us configure absolute paths for our app. We use this to easily import all of our functions and utilities inside of our `src` directory

‚Äî **_pages_**

The pages directory defines your routing. Lifecycle methods like `getStaticProps` / `getStaticPaths` / `getServerProps` are available at the page level. This is where we consume our MDX content as data to pass to our components.

`_app.js`:
NextJS allows you to override the App component, which is used to initialize pages. More [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app)

`_document.js`:
Allows you to augment our application's `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

`all-data/index.js`:
This page is an example of displaying links to all of your individual MDX data pages. Here we use `getStaticProps` to feed the frontmatter of our `MDX` files for our components.

`data/[slug].js`:
Here we utilize NextJS dynamic routing. By using `getStaticPaths` we're able to feed a dynamic slug, handling all of the logic once and applying it to each `MDX` data that we load. This allows us to then match to our data in `getStaticProps` and display that to the page and our components.

`index.js`:
Our page at the root of our app, lives inside of the `pages` directories `index.js`.

‚Äî **_src_**
Our `src` directory holds all of our client code. Our `components`, custom `hooks`, `utility` functions, and our `MDX` files all live here, with the first three available for absolute path imports üëç

‚Äî **_next.config.js_**
For custom configuration around things like `environment variables`, `webpack`, `pageExtensions`, and many [more](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/next-server/server/config.ts#L12-L63), you can utilize `next.config.js`

## Tailwind

This template uses the utility-first CSS framework **Tailwind** for styling. Take a look at the following files to get started.

‚Äî **_tailwind.config.js_**

Blank Tailwind configuration with the `purge` option to remove unused CSS in production, thus keeping the resulting CSS file small, and `theme.extend.colors` to add a custom color palette.

‚Äî **_postcss.config.js_**

PostCSS configuration file. Other than Tailwind, it uses Next.js's [default PostCSS configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config).

‚Äî **_src/tailwind.css_**

CSS file containing the `@tailwind` directive. It also contains examples of Tailwind's `@apply` directive and custom styles. You can rename and move it as you wish, but make sure you adjust the import path in `pages/_app.js`.

You can see examples of Tailwind CSS in action in these component files, `src/components/ContentBox.js` and `src/components/Navbar.js`.
